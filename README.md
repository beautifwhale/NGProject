# Installing Dependencies

## Linux/OSX

Run install.sh/installOSX.sh

This will build the libsocket library and install it in the /usr/lib folder on the system. The fork client and server, select client and server, and udp client and server will also build. 

## Running the project

For each version of the project navigate to the src/ folder. 
Run server binary first and then client with parameters using ./

```
cd ngproject/udp/udp_client/src/
./clientUDP <server-ipaddress> <username>
```
